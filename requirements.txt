🌱 Phase 1 — Data Collection & Loading (Data Scientist)

Collect the Iris dataset (iris.csv)

Load it using your DataLoader class

Inspect data with df.head(), df.info(), df.describe()

✅ Result: You have the dataset ready to work with

🌸 Phase 2 — Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Data Scientist)

Check for missing values or anomalies

Encode labels if necessary (LabelEncoder)

Split dataset into features (X) and target (y)

Use Preprocessor class for train-test split

✅ Result: Clean data ready for ML

🌼 Phase 3 — Exploratory Data Analysis (Data Scientist)

Visualize sepal vs petal measurements

Plot species distribution

Pairplots, histograms, scatter plots

Identify patterns for feature importance

✅ Result: Insights on what drives species prediction

🌷 Phase 4 — Model Building (AI/ML Engineer)

Choose ML models (Random Forest, SVM, KNN)

Use IrisModel class to train models on training data

Tune hyperparameters (optional)

✅ Result: Trained model(s) ready for evaluation

🌻 Phase 5 — Model Evaluation (Data Scientist & AI/ML Engineer)

Evaluate accuracy on test set

Confusion matrix, classification report

Compare different models if multiple are trained

✅ Result: Best performing model identified

🌺 Phase 6 — Model Saving & Deployment (AI/ML Engineer)

Save model as .pkl using joblib

Load model in Predictor class for inference

Integrate with Streamlit app

✅ Result: Model ready for real-time user predictions

🌹 Phase 7 — Interactive User Interface (Data Scientist & AI/ML Engineer)

Use Streamlit sliders / number inputs for measurements

Show predicted species immediately

Optionally display prediction probabilities or charts

Allow batch CSV upload for multiple flowers

✅ Result: Interactive, user-friendly ML application

🌼 Phase 8 — Reporting & Insights (Data Scientist)

Display visualizations and stats in Streamlit app

Show model performance metrics to user

Document workflow and explain OOP design

✅ Result: Complete ML project ready for portfolio

Optional Advanced Steps

Multiple models selection in Streamlit

Logging predictions for analysis

Deploy app on Streamlit Cloud or Heroku

Retrain model with new data
